# GodotSteam for Godot Engine 3.x | Community Edition
An ecosystem of tools for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) and [Valve's Steam](https://store.steampowered.com). For the Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms.

**Notice: GodotSteam for Godot 3.x is now semi-retired. This branch still works fine but will not receive any further feature updates.  However, it will receive necessary bug fixes and builds will be produced for new Godot 3.x versions.**

Compatibility
---
While rare, sometimes Steamworks SDK updates will break compatilibity with older GodotSteam versions. Any compatability breaks are noted below. Newer API files (dll, so, dylib) _should_ still work for older versions.

Steamworks SDK Version | GodotSteam Version
---|---
1.63 or newer | 3.31 or newer
1.62 | 3.29 to 3.30.2
1.61 | 3.28
1.59 to 1.60 | 3.23 to 3.27
1.53 to 1.58a | 3.12 to 3.22.4
1.52 or older | 3.11.1 or older

Versions of GodotSteam that have compatibility breaks introduced.
